# AI Response Parser - Extract Reliable Structured Data from LLMs

**Title**: AI Response Parser - Extract Reliable Structured Data from LLMs

## What It Does
Production-ready parser for extracting structured data from LLM responses:
- ✅ JSON validation and automatic repair
- ✅ Schema enforcement (ensure response matches expected format)
- ✅ Batch processing engine (parse 1000s of responses reliably)
- ✅ Error detection and recovery
- ✅ Type casting and validation
- ✅ Custom parsing rules support

## Real Problems Solved
**Before**: 30-40% of LLM responses are malformed JSON
**After**: Automatic detection and repair = 99%+ valid structured data

**Before**: Manual cleanup of invalid responses wastes engineering time
**After**: Automated parsing saves hours per week

## Use Cases
- Data pipeline builders (extracting structured insights)
- Production reliability (ensure data integrity)
- Batch processing (analyzing 10K+ items)
- ETL systems (LLM-powered data processing)
- API integrations (reliable data contracts)

## What's Included
- Complete Python implementation
- JSON validation and repair system
- Schema definition tools
- Batch processing engine
- Error recovery patterns
- Production deployment guide
- Testing framework

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- ~20MB disk space

## Price: $35

**Key Angle**: Reliability and data integrity. Tests market: "Stop malformed responses" vs "Batch processing at scale."
