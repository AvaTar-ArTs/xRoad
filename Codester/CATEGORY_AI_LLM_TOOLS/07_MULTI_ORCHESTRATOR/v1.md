**Title**: Multi-Model LLM Orchestrator - Claude, GPT, Ollama, Qwen, Grok

## What It Does
Enterprise-ready system for managing multiple LLM providers:
- ✅ Switch between Claude, GPT-4, Ollama, Qwen, Grok instantly (no code changes)
- ✅ Automatic failover (provider down = use backup automatically)
- ✅ Load balancing across providers
- ✅ Cost optimization routing (cheapest option per request)
- ✅ Provider comparison tools
- ✅ Unified API interface

## Real Problems Solved
**Before**: "OpenAI is down, my app is broken"
**After**: Automatic failover to Claude or local Ollama = no downtime

**Before**: Vendor lock-in with one provider
**After**: Switch providers anytime, zero lock-in

## Use Cases
