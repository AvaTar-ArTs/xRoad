# OpenAI API Client - Production-Ready with Cost Tracking

**Title**: OpenAI API Client - Production-Ready with Cost Tracking

## What It Does
Production-ready Python client for OpenAI API with enterprise features built in:
- ✅ Real-time cost monitoring per request
- ✅ Automatic retry + exponential backoff error handling
- ✅ Token counting before API calls (predict costs)
- ✅ Request logging and audit trails
- ✅ Batch processing with progress tracking
- ✅ Multi-model support (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.)

## Real Problems Solved
**Before**: Surprise API bills ($500-2000/month overages)
**After**: Know exact costs before making requests, prevent runaway bills

**Before**: Production crashes from rate limits or timeouts
**After**: Built-in retry logic + exponential backoff = reliable scaling

## Use Cases
- Building production AI features with cost visibility
- Batch processing (analyzing 10K+ documents reliably)
- Enterprise applications requiring audit trails
- Teams needing cost accountability and chargeback models
- API integrations requiring production reliability

## What's Included
- Complete Python 3.8+ implementation
- 15+ production examples (error handling, batch processing)
- Cost calculator tool (pre-calculate total expenses)
- Monitoring dashboard code
- API logging + analytics setup guide
- Deployment checklist for production

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- ~50MB disk space

## Price: $45
