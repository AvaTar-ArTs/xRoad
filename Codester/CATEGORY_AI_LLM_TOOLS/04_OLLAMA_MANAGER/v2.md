# Local AI Models - Complete Ollama Management System

**Title**: Local AI Models - Complete Ollama Management System

## What It Does
Production-ready system for managing Ollama LLMs at scale:
- ✅ Model download automation (5+ models with dependencies)
- ✅ Hardware profiling system (CPU/GPU/RAM detection)
- ✅ Multi-instance orchestration (run multiple models simultaneously)
- ✅ Model caching and optimization
- ✅ Performance monitoring and logging
- ✅ Easy model switching (CLI + API interfaces)

## Real Problems Solved
