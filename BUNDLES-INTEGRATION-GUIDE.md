## 💰 Bundle Pricing Psychology

### Entry Point Strategy
```
Individual Products: $29-69 each
    ↓
Bundle A (Cost Optimizer): $99
├─ 3 products saved $20
├─ Clear ROI in 1-2 weeks
└─ Low friction to convert

Bundle B (Flexibility): $169
├─ 3 products saved $30
├─ Mid-market value proposition
└─ Natural upgrade from A

Bundle C (Intelligence): $139
├─ 3 products saved $40
├─ Specialist use case
└─ Alternative to A or B

Bundle D (Mastery): $299
├─ 7 products saved $125
├─ Premium positioning
└─ Anchors all pricing perception
```

### Anchoring Effect
By placing Bundle Mastery at $299, we create a mental anchor that makes:
- Bundle B at $169 feel like "midmarket sweet spot"
- Bundle A at $99 feel like "no-brainer entry"
- Bundle C at $139 feel like "specialized specialist choice"
