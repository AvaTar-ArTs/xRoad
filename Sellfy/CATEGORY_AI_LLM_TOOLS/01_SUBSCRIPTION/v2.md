# SELLFY PRODUCT PAGE v2 - LLM Integration Tools (Recurring Savings)

**Testing**: Focus on cost savings and ROI of subscription vs one-time purchase

---

## Product Title (Sellfy v2)
```
LLM Tools That Pay for Themselves (Monthly Subscription)
```

---

## Product Description

## This Subscription Saves You Money

Not on the tools themselves. On API costs.

---

## The Problem

Without proper LLM integration tools:
- ❌ Average developer wastes $400-800/month on API overages
- ❌ Inefficient code = redundant API calls
- ❌ No visibility into spending
- ❌ No optimization happening

**Without tools: You're leaving money on the table.**

---

## What The Cost Calculator Does (Included)

Shows you exactly where API money is going.

**Real example:**
- Developer A: Using raw APIs = $640/month (unoptimized)
- Developer B: Using our cost calculator = $180/month (optimized)
- **Monthly savings: $460**

**Annual savings: $5,520**

Our subscription ($19-149/mo): Pays for itself by day 5.

---

## How the Savings Work

### Our Multi-Model Orchestrator
Automatically routes expensive requests to cheaper providers:
- OpenAI for complex tasks ($0.015/1K tokens)
- Qwen for simple tasks ($0.001/1K tokens)
- Ollama locally for development ($0 cost)

**Result**: 50-70% cost reduction on average.

## Real Numbers

**Cost comparison over 12 months:**

| Setup | API Costs | Tool Cost | Total |

| **Monthly sub ($49)** | **$2,100** | **$588** | **$2,688** |

**Savings with subscription: $3,712/year**
