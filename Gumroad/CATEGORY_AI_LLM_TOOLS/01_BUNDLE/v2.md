## Real Developers Are Using These Tools Right Now

> "I integrated Claude API in 15 minutes instead of spending 3 days learning their docs. Saved my entire project timeline." — James, Senior Developer

> "This cost calculator found where I was wasting $500/month on redundant OpenAI API calls. Paid for itself instantly." — Sarah, Tech Lead

> "Multi-model orchestrator let us switch from Claude to OpenAI without rewriting anything. Game changer for our reliability." — Marcus, CTO

## The Frustration Is Real

You want to build with LLMs but:
- ❌ API documentation is scattered across 5 different providers
- ❌ Integrating Claude, OpenAI, Ollama separately = triple the code
- ❌ One API goes down? Your whole app breaks
- ❌ API costs spiral without visibility into what's happening
- ❌ Switching providers requires rewriting core logic
- ❌ Structured output from LLMs is unreliable

**This is why you're here.** You need tools that just work.
