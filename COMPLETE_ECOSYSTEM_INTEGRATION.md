## 🎯 KEY DECISION: Platform Priority

### **Option A: Lemon Squeezy-First** (Recommended based on strategic message)
- Subscriptions as core business model
- All 6 categories with subscription tiers
- Recurring revenue foundation
- Individual products + bundles as complementary channels
- Better for nocTurneMeLoDieS + AVATARARTS ecosystems

### **Option B: Codester-First** (Original plan without CodeCanyon)
- Organic discovery drives volume
- Gumroad bundles + email list as secondary revenue
- Lemon Squeezy as premium tier
- Less recurring revenue, more one-time purchases

### **Option C: Parallel (Recommended for maximum reach)**
